l "\"And Carl, well, God knows that he has enough damn rooms that go unused.\""
l "\"His parents are barely ever there.\""
l "\"You could be like that one movie with the boy who lived in the walls of the house, making spooky noises at night and eating their gorgonzola.\""
"I let out a small chuckle."
"I remember how Carl used to be really afraid of ghosts a few years ago."
"I got to hang out with him and play videogames as a coping mechanism excuse."
"Still, now that I have my phone in hand, I still have that same twisting dread within my gut."
