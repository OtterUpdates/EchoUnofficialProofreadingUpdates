"He started out fine, managing simple English and explaining how he promised he was going to protect us all from now on."
"And then he just... kept saying, '{i}I'm sorry{/i}', over and over again."
"Jasmynn was the first to step up and hug him, then Carl, then TJ, then me, and finally Flynn."
"We held each other outside the road and sobbed. Flynn kept yelling something and seemed more incensed than mourning, but I wasn't listening to his words."
"Leo bawled until he was hiccuping, wrought with himself. We all did."
"Eventually, a passerby called one of our parents and we were picked up, one by one."
"The funeral had happened the week before and our parents thought we were ready to... reintegrate, that things were better."

"But Leo was always there, keeping his promise."

"I shut my eyes tight and kiss him, my arms trembling as I do so."
"Large arms envelop me, his grasp first on my waist, but then upon my face as he holds onto my tear-matted cheeks."
"I realize I have no idea what I'm doing with regard to kissing, and I feel like a fool mushing my face against his, but Leo doesn't laugh."
"The kiss is over rather quickly, but I embrace him as soon as our muzzles part."
"I feel his head rub into mine, a neediness to his demeanor that I share."
"We continue to stand each on our own rail, keeping equilibrium, balanced at the center."
"This makes the hug sort of awkward in structure."
"It actually reminds me a lot of church pamphlets TJ had that described the proper way to hug someone of the opposite sex:"
"'Backs hunched forward, arms around the upper torso, pelvises at least a foot apart from one another.'"
