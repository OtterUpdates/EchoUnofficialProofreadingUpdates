# Unofficial Proofreading Updates for Echo and Route 65
I did a re-read of Echo and Route 65 and decided to proofread it at the same time. The TL;DR is that I think ~98-99% of the issues in Echo and Route 65 are fixed by my edits here, and hopefully 100% of the noticeable ones. It's hard to say how many individual fixes I actually performed, but going by a git diff line count there's 3.7k lines changed, and about ~750 notes added. To be clear, before I started I didn't know it was going to be this bad! I guess during my first read of Echo I turned off my brain in order to get through the grammar, and I didn't realize how many errors I was skimming past. I generally proofread and submit corrections for any ebooks I read, but the worst case I'd had before this was about ~200 corrections in a 500k word book, so this was a new level of magnitude for me. My primary motivation was simply to do a second read of Echo, but at the same time I also wanted to clean up all the glaring typos so that I could recommend this talking animal book to my friends and have them take it seriously.

I did reach out to the Echo Project team a few times via their Patreon messages and the email they have posted, but I haven't received any response after waiting a couple months. I'm not sure what sort of contact methods they actually pay attention to, so if anyone knows how to put this on their radar be my guest; I refuse to make a Twitter account to reach them that way. In the meantime, I'm just releasing this here so people who might be interested in a re-read have access to it.

### Usage notes:
Grab the source code from the [latest release](https://github.com/OtterUpdates/EchoUnofficialProofreadingUpdates/releases/latest) and extract the .rpy files into the nested "game" folder of Echo or Route 65 (i.e., Echo\game\\*.rpy), then relaunch the game.

### List of things I remember doing:
* Most (all? hard to say for sure with a story like Echo) plot/detail inconsistencies either fixed or noted. Often an inconsistency would require a larger rework to fix, but there are still a lot that can be objectively fixed without consultation, e.g. Chase referring to his roommate as a "rabbit", Leo's van constantly being misremembered as a "truck", and Clint's ever-changing species
* Fixed tons of misspellings, malapropisms, and general "hard grammar" mistakes, e.g. "any more/anymore", "then/than", "it's/its"
* So many missing/dropped words. I think I fixed 98%+ of these, but it's really impossible to know for sure since your brain automatically fills in the gaps unless you read aloud/read twice.
* Tons of formatting errors, e.g. missing quotation marks, incorrect punctuation, missing punctuation, missing font styles etc.
* General word consistency. If a word or phrase is spelled/compounded/represented in a certain way, all instances of it should match. I did this with most important/noticeable things, but there's likely a few desyncs from things only mentioned ~2 times that I didn't pick up on
* Readability improvements or notes where the writing is noticeably clunky or repetitive, e.g. writing "finally" 3 times in one sentence
* All the bad music loops were fixed. Basically, there were certain sections where going backwards one dialogue step would permanently cut the currently-playing music off. All of these sections were during super important moments, so it was very likely that those scenes would be ruined for an average reader.
* A handful of bugs/quirks in the programming fixed, e.g. backgrounds displaying at the wrong times and unintentional pauses between dialogue boxes.
* You can actually fuckin' read the Route 65 intro quote now! I just made the quote screens wait until you click before advancing. I swear, no one in the world can read that quote before it fades away.
* Added a ton of commas where they're noticeably absent for readability. Not even close to making every sentence perfectly grammatically correct, since realistically you'd want to fully restructure hopeless sentences instead of throwing commas at them. I let probably ~80% of the comma "errors" slide if they had a sufficient reading flow, and since Echo is told through very casual speech patterns it's easy enough to ignore "perfect grammar" as a reader. If this was my own writing I'd probably spend a lot more time smoothing things out, but in this case I didn't want to hand the original authors 15k lines of nitpicks. My standards for what commas I wanted to fix changed throughout my reading, so Route 65, Echo's intro, Carl, and Leo probably have different comma allowances than later routes. Later routes were also MUCH better written to begin with. I generally also let missing semicolons/colons/emdashes slide if they were instead represented with commas. The end result is that the text is nowhere near book quality, but you shouldn't be stumbling over sentence structures or reading flow.
* Loads and loads of manual notes next to sentences. I used them when I wasn't fully confident of a fix, when a line needed more comprehensive restructuring, or when something needed authoritative input (i.e., the authors, in theory). All my notes start with "#!" and a varying amount of "!"s, e.g. "#!!!!" is more important than "#!!!".
* Generally, the "content" of Echo and Route 65 is unchanged. Aside from some opportune fixes for inconsistencies, all sentences more or less have the same words as before, just in a more correct and pleasant format.

There are still a few noticeable problems/detail inconsistencies left in the text, but they should all at least have a note next to them. I'd say this work is a pretty solid base for what I'd consider a 1.0 of Echo. It's not perfect, but it's a massive first step that should be supplemented by further fine-tuning. Ideally this new text would have a few test readers and some peer review on all the changes, but this is all I can do with a single read by myself. If you use this text to do a re-read, I would really appreciate it if you send notes or a PR on anything that's still not quite right!

I included some [notes](/notes-and-regex.md) for things I didn't get around to doing, as well as a big chunk of RegEx patterns that I used to programmatically find issues before reading. If you want to compare my fixes to the original text, you'll want to use some kind of text diff tool (I personally use VSCode), or check the diffs directly on GitHub.

I also found a lot of issues in Arches at the same time due to how I scanned for errors, but I haven't done a manual re-read of it yet. I'll probably do that and commit a fixed copy eventually, but Arches is way cleaner to begin with and doesn't really need fixing as desperately as Echo does. I've been very busy IRL lately so that will happen when it happens.
